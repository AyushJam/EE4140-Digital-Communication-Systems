# Course Projects
Welcome to the EE4140 Repository!

# SA1
The assignment aims to demonstrate the action of pulse shaping filters, analyze the theoretical probability of error and the bounds studied by verifying against simulation, and simulate a distorting (ISI) channel modeled as an L-tap channel to study the performance of the Viterbi Algorithm, a Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation (MLSE) approach.

# SA2
Here, we simulate an LMMSE (Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error) based Linear Equalizer (LE) and a Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE). The process is analyzed, simulated and evaluated against the two methods and the earlier Viterbi Algorithm too.

# Each folder contains:
- code implementing the assignment
- a report explaining the work
- plots

# Final Project
We implement the Beneveniste and Goursat Blind Adaptive Algorithm and compare its performance with the Statistical Wiener Filter (LMMSE) Equalizer. The folder contains the presentation that summarises this work. The file `code` is a Jupyter Notebook for the corresponding code.
