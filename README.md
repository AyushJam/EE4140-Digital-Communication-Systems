# Simulation Assignments and Course Project
Welcome to the EE4140 Repository!

# SA1
The assignment aims to demonstrate the action of pulse shaping filters, analyze the theoretical probability of error and the bounds studied by verifying against simulation, and simulate a distorting (ISI) channel modeled as an L-tap channel to study the performance of the Viterbi Algorithm, a Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation (MLSE) approach.

# SA2
Here, we simulate an LMMSE (Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error) based Linear Equalizer (LE) and a Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE). The process is analyzed, simulated and evaluated against the two methods and the earlier Viterbi Algorithm too.

# Each folder contains:
- code implementing the assignment
- a report explaining the work
- plots
